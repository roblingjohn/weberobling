# WeBeRobling

In the time between the original date of my wedding and the first date we rescheduled due to COVID, I took a web development boot camp course and learned to make a website from scratch. After we had to reschedule again, the original registration of our wedding website has expired, so I decided to make my own. 

Please note that this site is only included as a demonstration of my coding ability. Viewing it here does not constitute an invitation to the wedding.
